											Introduction
											<br>
											Hello everyone, Welcome to another Special Episode of 3 Techies Banter. 
											Our Podcast wherein we look in a fun and light hearted manner, we try to dissect all our topics in simple Language which is easily understandable and relatable by all of you and this Episode is another effort to do the same. 
											What I thought was that I will introduce this Episode with the story and what I realise is the best source of the information and humour is actually LinkedIn, so I went across LinkedIn and found this Guy who have actually worked on FaceBook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix and Google but there is a twist if you back into his profile if you read it says, he uses FaceBook, Loves Googling is name while ordering his favourite from Amazon and posting Apple updates from Apple phone upto 8months, additionally he manages Netflix account for all 5 members of family, so this is the LinkedIn profile of an individually which shows that he have worked in top most company but because there is no real way to verify it.

											Hi, I am Sheetal. Welcome to 3TB, a podcast where 3 techies banter. It's a podcast where you can explore tech in a non-tech way. It is about how tech and economics behind the tech impact us today and in the future. We have useful information, fun facts, and common sense that is spoken in a language that everybody can understand. Today we are doing a special which is a Christmas special for you and the way we thought about it is that, imagine that every year Santa goes around the globe delivering gifts to kids below the age of 15 i would think. All of us believe in Santa but who really believe in the power of Santa and believe that they should leave out some cookies and milk for Santa and things like that. If we have 1.5 billion kids approximately around the planet who need these gifts to be delivered in one night, Santa goes around delivering gifts around that one night.

											Hi I am Sheetal, Welcome to 3TB. All of us are busy and welcoming Ganpati Bappa into our home, we decided therefore we will give this week Podcast and instead create small Episode which is our Ganesh Chaturthi special.
											<br>
											So as the part of this small Episode, so what we thought we will share some of the information and interesting facts about Ganesh Utsav, some of you might already know it, but the historical perspective of Ganesh Utsav especially the Sarvajanik Ganesh Utsav the public and community celebration, lies in late 1800s and many of you would be aware that it was started by Bal Gangadhar Tilak and idea was very interesting that Britishers have started this whole ban around social gatherings and the only things that was exempt from that Ban were religious gatherings and that is the reason why Muslim of that Era they could congregate for Friday Prayers, but incidentally there is no such option for Hindu Gathering because there is no such event weekly or monthly.</p>

Hi, I am Samiran.
I am Nilesh

Hi I am Sheetal, and you are listening to 3TB, 3 Techies Banter.
<br>
Hi, everyone this is Samiran, Sheetal, Nilesh, we are back with another episode of 3 Techies Banter, this is the Podcast that looks at Tech in a non-tech way, in fact I am wondering if we may have coined or patented the fun Tech.
<br>
So this was really our attempt to make tech conversational, make it easy and understandable and relatable to all of you.
<br>
In season 2 we have taken the thematic approach, so we did the India stag 1st and now we have moved down to everyday Tech, we did the Home automation in 1st Episode, now we are going to look at Health as an area, of course Health is extremely Large and vast, so kind of its narrow it down to everyday health which you and I interact with and use which is probably Oximeter have become really very close to you device because of COVID, but we will look at little more as we go along.

Hi everyone, I am Sheetal Choksi, welcome to 3TB, a podcast where 3 techies banter. It's a podcast where you can explore tech, the non tech way. It is about the tech, economics behind the tech as of today and in the future. It's full of information, fun facts, common sense actually spoken in a language that everyone understands, in plain simple English and no tech jargon. Last one we covered an interesting theme called the India stack and we covered all aspects of the India stack in great detail. This month we are picking up a new theme and this is something which impacts all our lives on a day to day basis. The theme for this month is everyday tech. What we want to really cover is things we do on a day to day basis without even realizing that there is technology behind it.

Hi Samiran and Nilesh. You know I was just reading the marketoonist and the comic strips around it and the one that really caught my attention and has some relevance in today’s conversation was an interesting one on shopping and e-commerce shopping specifically. You have this lady who is obviously placing her orders on Amazon through Alexa and she is telling Alexa - “Alexa, please place an order for Kleenex ”. For some of you who may not be aware, Kleenex is a brand for tissues. So she places this order and says, reorder Kleenex and of course Alexa pops up and says, Amazon brand tissues are at 50% off. And so this woman goes saying, i said Kleenex and Alexa again say, Amazon brand is at 50% off. Now this lady is getting a little angry and she says, Kleenex, I said Kleenex.

<br>
Hi, I am Nilesh Patankar. Welcome to the second season of 3TB, a podcast where 3 techies’ banter. It is a podcast where you explore tech the non-tech way. It is about tech, economics behind the tech, impact today and in the future. In Season 2 we have tweaked the format a little bit based on the feedback we received. So what we are going to do in season 2 is, we are going to take up a topic and treat it as a theme of the month. As a theme of the month we will have about 3-4 episodes dedicated to a particular theme. The aim was that in a way we will do justice to a topic in a structured manner and hopefully we are planning to get in the 4th episode in every theme a relevant guest. So the whole idea is to make it contextual, to make it structured and make it more relevant for all you to grasp the information so that was the idea.
